Here is an attempt to make an index of aggregate risk. As we should expect from previous attempts, a simple KDE classifier is not accurate on the data we have. We have yet to see if it can be considered accurate "in aggregate", that is, how well it can predict the proportions of risky events in groups. It is also possible that the method can be salvaged by some appropriate data transformation.
