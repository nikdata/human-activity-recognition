Each file is processed as it arrives, since the final form takes considerably less memory because
we are downsampling by a significant factor and discarding most infomration from most events.

    Put the acceleration data into a standard form.
    
    By calling pd.concat on the result, we can make a full table without
    having every incident in memory simultaneously. If there is no trigger with
    a wide enough window around it, we still return the data frames but make them empty.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    acceleration: DataFrame[['x'],['y'],['z']]
        a frame containing the acceleration in its columns. This may include more than one
        incident; the incidents will be separated automatically.
    incident_id: str or int
        the label to attach to the incident. This should be unique, and give enough information
        to find where the incident came from.
    motion: str
        'slip', 'trip', 'fall', or 'other'
    sample_rate: int
        the rate in Hz of the acquisition. This will be used to resample the data to 25Hz.
    incident_threshold:
        because of differences in mass and geometry of the accelerometers, it may make sense
        to choose a different acceleration threshold depending on which accelerometer was used.
        An incident will be returned only when there is a peak with absolute value greater than
        this threshold.
    time_threshold:
        incidents are only counted if the trigger occurs with this much time before and after, in milliseconds.
    
    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame[['x'],['y'],['z'],['motion']]
        doubly indexed by incident_id, then by milliseconds, with 0 corresponding to the incident
        trigger. A suffix is added to incident_id if there is more than one incident.
